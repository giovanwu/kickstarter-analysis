*Louise should lower her fundraising goal to around $5,000, as her original goal estimate of $10,000 is more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal ($5,049).
*If Louise is interested in starting a campaign in Great britain, she should try to get her play produced for less than £4,000, since half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
*Since most of the successful theater/plays campaigns reached their goal within a month of the launch, it is important for Louise to mkae sure that she looks into how these successful campaigns were promoted in order to reach their target audience. 
*Throughout the successful theater/plays campaigns in the U.S., most of them have under 100 backers, which means that if Louise is able to get her campaign to reach her target audience, her campaign will most likely be able to succeed.

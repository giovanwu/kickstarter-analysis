-Louise should start her campaign around May, since theater campaigns with a launch date in May proved to generate the most amount of successful campaigns (111) throughout the year.

-Louise should lower her fundraising goal to around $5,000, as her original goal estimate of $10,000 is more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal ($5,049).
-If Louise is interested in starting a campaign in Great britain, she should try to get her play produced for less than £4,000, since half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
-Since most of the successful theater/plays campaigns reached their goal within a month of the launch, it is important for Louise to mkae sure that she looks into how these successful campaigns were promoted in order to reach their target audience. 
-Throughout the successful theater/plays campaigns in the U.S., most of them have under 100 backers, which means that if Louise is able to get her campaign to reach her target audience, her campaign will most likely be able to succeed.

# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
Louise needs recommendations to help better set up her campaign by using data provided from past campaigns
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to see how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

While I did not encounter any specific challenges or difficulties, a possible difficulty people may encounter is when you don't put the correct fields in the PivotChart Fields, and that would mess up the PivotChart.
## Results
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
-Louise should launch her campaign in May, since most of the successful theater campaigns are launched in May.
-December is the worst month to launch a campaign, as December contains the least amount of successful campaigns launched throughout the year, so it's best for Louise to avoid launching her campaign in December.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaigns that have a goal amount of less than $1000 have the highest campaign successful rate (76%).
### Limitations of the dataset
Since we are only looking at campaign data between 2009 and 2017, a lot has changed in regards to the methods that people have used to promote their campaigns; Therefore, it is tough to compare a successful campaign back in 2009 with a successful campaign in 2017.
### Recommended Tables or Graphs
A table that shows the correlation between the time span of a campaign and the outcome of a campaign could be useful for Louise to specifically look into how a successful campaign that reached its goal within a short time span managed to do so.
